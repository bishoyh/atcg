## Blood Transcription Modules ##
A new tool to analyze blood transcriptome data, alternative to canonical pathways but with detailed immunology (Li et al 2014. Nature Immunology. 15:195). Package and tutorial can be downloaded from Nature site: http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v15/n2/extref/ni.2789-S5.zip .

## Metabolomics ##
Rapid functional analysis for high throughput, mass spec based metabolomics -
mummichog performs pathway and network analysis without the need of a priori identification of metabolites (Li et al. 2013. PLoS Computational Biology. 9:e10031323).

## MetaFishNet ##
MetaFishNet is a genome-wide fish metabolic network model (Li et al 2010. Genome Biology 11:R 115). This includes data for metabolic pathways and reactions, as well as programs for sequence analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. The MetaFishNet project is hosted at http://metafishnet.appspot.com/ .

## Oligonucleotides and DNA microarrays ##
Modeling of DNA microarray hybridization (Li et al 2008. Nucleic Acid Research 36: 6585). Utilities for computing oligonucleotide properties, with application to PCR and more.
