This site contains several programs for MetaFishNet, which include “SeaSpider” for sequence analysis, “FishEye” for pathway visualization, and “FisherExpress” for pathway enrichment analysis. SeaSpider is used for both the initial construction and for mapping new sequences to MetaFishNet. The source code is found under "Source" page.
